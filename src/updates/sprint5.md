## **Sprint #5 2/9-2/12 - Feature Freeze Week!**

With only a four day week and feature freeze approaching rapidly, we pushed to get as many things completed as possible. After thoroughly considering feedback from last week's playtesting, we made significant adjustments to the player. Some of the notable adjustments include adding player hitstun, implementing an invincibility system, and re-adding player “fling” from the leaf dash with adjustable velocity and gravity. Additionally, we created 12 trigger classes and added a screen transition system which should also aid in the level and room implementation. We also made significant iterations on our game logo thanks to input from a variety of students and advisors.

Throughout the week, we got a lot of good feedback from a professor who listened to the current draft of our level music, and from the 12 total playtesting sessions we ran with current students. This week's playtesting feedback pushed us to make significant progress on design by coming up with some new design guides that will help us solidify our design principles. Some of our ideas were:
- Don’t stop moving
- The leaf dash is a performance 
- There should be moments where the player is pressured through time-based events or enemies chasing them 

This week, we made a lot of progress on integration tasks as well. We scripted out major conversations, implemented NPC movement during dialogue sequences, and began adding character profiles to the dialogue (the character profiles were all created  by one of our lovely contractors). We also implemented a grab animation that we received last week. 

Our contractors worked very hard to complete the long list of tasks we assigned to them this week as well. One of them made significant progress with attaching audio assets to the gameplay. They made both a walk animation for our companion character and a jump animation for our main character. They also made progress on door assets, floor tiles, and shaders. Lastly, they helped us do some debugging as we prepared for this week's build.
