## **Sprint #2 1/20-1/23 - Early Prototype Week!**

This sprint, we made strides with the core game systems and critical assets. We created a state machine-driven player entity with easily tunable parameters. The player can run, jump, and leaf dash. We also held four playtesting sessions to get initial feedback on player movement. We created a dynamic moving platform system and a few basic obstacles. Additionally, we got the scene manager and gameplay manager up and running. Once we set these up, we started setting up and testing room and door mechanics. On the UI side, we set a godot theme that matches our UI standards and added our chosen font. Once this was done, we created initial scenes for the main menu, main settings menu, and save selection menu.

We made good steps in terms of level design as well. We designed many of the obstacles we plan to use, and we blocked out all of the rooms and challenges we plan to have in the cellar level. We also made significant progress on narrative. We filled out all but the pipeline in the narrative bible and outlined the level plot structure which included a detailed map describing the content of individual scenes. We then identified the kinds of writing necessary for the game and nearly completed the first draft of the core dialogue.

Most of our art and audio progress comes from the contractors that we onboarded last week. They created keyframe animations for Az’s idle movement and Fenn’s walking and jumping animations. They also established a palette and design guidelines for our environment tilesets. Moreover, they finalized a slanted wood tile texture and made progress on a stone wall tile texture. For audio, our contractors found and imported necessary placeholder sound effects, created audio stream randomizers for footsteps which were implemented for the player, and began working on a background audio manager.  We also onboarded another art contractor to help us work through our tilesets faster.

For marketing, we worked out a sitemap for our website that presents high-level information upfront and hosts in-depth information in subdirectories for other developers. To promote playtesting, we put up posters advertising playtesting with information on how to join our playtesting email alias. We posted this information on our instagram too.
