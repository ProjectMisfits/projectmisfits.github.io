Project Misfits kicked off with a short, three day week. We worked to make strides on critical documentation and onboard some incoming contractors. On the technical side, we drafted the complete Tech Bible and established our GitHub organization. The organization currently houses both the initial Godot project repository we made and the set-up we did for the team website. Additionally, we decided to use plugins to help enhance the development process. We added InkGD and LimboAI to the Godot project and researched Godot’s built-in audio system.

For art, we reorganized and are in the process of adding the final touches to the art bible. Additionally, we gathered all current artwork from existing contractors and decided on the next art tasks to give to our incoming contractors. We detailed and presented these tasks to the contractors midway through the week. Additionally, we created simple colored UI mock-ups to get initial visualization of the assets.

For audio, we were also able to complete the respective bible and decide on what audio assets would come from in-house and what needed to be contracted. After, we onboarded the incoming audio contractor who will be finding placeholder sound effects. We also made significant progress in design by formatting the Design Bible and documenting all current design decisions. The list of design decisions cover the following areas:
    
- Companion ability
- Platforming rooms
- Enemies and challenge objects
- Menu and dialogue UI
- Play design and abilities
- Obstacles and threats 

We set up the Narrative Bible and started matching narrative beats to the level designs. We also drafted the Playtesting Bible and a playtesting notes template. Lastly, we started an Instagram account and posted a very simple introduction to the project.
